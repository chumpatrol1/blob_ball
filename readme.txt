Can be played with either Keyboard or Controller

**How to Play**
Both players start on opposite sides of the field, with a white ball in the middle.
Players can push the ball on contact with their characters.
If the ball goes into the opposite colored zone, you score a point!
You can attack your enemy with your kick or with some abilities. If your opponent gets KO'd, you score a point!
Score 5 points to win - this can be adjusted in the "Rules" Menu

Special Buttons:
Kicks launch the ball and turn it red. If your opponent is nearby, they will take 2 damage!
If your opponent runs out of HP, you gain a point!
Blocks stop the ball completely and turn it blue. The area that stops the ball is a rectangle.
If an enemy kicks you while you are blocking, you will parry the attack and nullify the damage!
Boosts consume Energy, which passively builds during a match.
Using your Boost gives you a yellow glow, makes you faster, and increases your kick damage by 1!
Abilities consume Energy, and each blob has a different ability.
Some abilities need to be held down, others are single use, and others have a delay. Try them all!

Advanced Techniques:
Hold up to jump higher!
Press down while in the air to fall more quickly!
Press down while on the ground to Focus - this builds up energy more quickly!
Press up while focusing to cancel your focus - you'll be in the air though!
If you are moving at maximum speed, you can tap the opposite direction to wavebounce (reversing direction quickly!)
