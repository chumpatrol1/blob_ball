#1: Cheat Cartridge's initial speed is
based on your momentum and direction!

#2: Leave a cartridge by your goal so
you can go on the offensive!

#3: Boost kicking your opponent will leave
a console on the ground. They will be
forcibly teleported after a few seconds,
or alternatively they can hold down to
teleport once the console starts sparking.

#4: Cartridges have a limited lifespan,
and afterwards Arcade Blob will be teleported.
