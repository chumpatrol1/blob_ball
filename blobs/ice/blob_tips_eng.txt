#1: Snowball doesn't stop the ball instantly,
but it will change the ball's trajectory
significantly and cause it to hover!

#2: Ice Blob is slippery on the ground, but has
average air friction for better acceleration

#3: Slowing down the ball slightly can cause
opponents to mistime their abilities and jumps

#4: You can use your block as an emergency
brake since it halts all momentum

#5: Boost Kicking applies a hypothermia effect
which applies a slowing effect to your enemy!
