#1: Glue Gun shoots its pellets
based on your momentum and direction!

#2: Once a glue puddle is formed, it
dries up in about three seconds!

#3: Glue Blob synergizes well with its 
own glue. In fact, you will move slightly
faster across the field!

#4: In addition to the slowing effect of
the glue, you should remember that your
enemies will have a hard time jumping out
of the glue, and the ball bounces less too!

#5: For 300 energy, wavedashing will create
several pellets of glue that can cover the
whole field.
