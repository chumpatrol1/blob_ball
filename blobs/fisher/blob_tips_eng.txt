#1: Fisher Blob hooks onto the ball
faster if the ball is closeby!

#2: Fisher Blob is extra vulnerable when
using Hook - he takes +1 damage
from all sources!

#3: You can block Hook from working by
using your block on the ball!

#4: A spicy trick you can do is called
Threading the Loop. Jump, hook the ball
and have it spin around you before letting go.

#5: Kicking Fisher Blob or the ball while
hook is active will force Hook into cooldown.
