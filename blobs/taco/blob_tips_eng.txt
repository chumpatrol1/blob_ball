#1: Each filling (Meat, Hot Sauce, Cheese, and
Vegan Crunch) has its own cooldown.

#2: Cheese (Up) increases your jump height
and air control, but you also take extra damage.
When landing, you will summon spires!

#3: Hot Sauce (Right) increases your
horizontal speed greatly, but you are 
vulnerable to damage.

#4: Vegan Crunch (Down) decreases the damage you take
and makes your blocks frequent. You also take less damage!

#5: Meat (Left) increases your kick damage, pierce and
reduces your kick cooldown. The meat is too greasy
for your shell so you take more damage, though.
