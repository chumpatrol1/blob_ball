#1: Geyser's effect gets weaker the further
up the ball is

#2: If the ball is rolling towards the enemy 
goal, you can tap the ability button to
launch the ball a little bit

#3: Blocking the ball prevents Geyser's
effect from working

#4: If you are focusing to charge energy,
remember that you can always jump to cancel
your focus early!

#5: Need even more energy?! Time your block so
that you parry an incoming blow as early as
possible, gaining 300 energy! That's about 10
seconds of gameplay, or about half a boost!
