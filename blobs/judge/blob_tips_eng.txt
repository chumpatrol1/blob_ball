#1: Cease and Desist does not stop delayed
abilities after they have been started

#2: C&D can be used as a pseudoblock,
preventing you from taking damage
for a bit

#3: C&D does not increase cooldowns,
but simply blocks use of any powers

#4: Judge Blob's boost kick is a short stun.
If the opponent is C&D'd, the stun lasts longer.
