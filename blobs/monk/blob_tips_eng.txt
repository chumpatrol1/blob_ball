#1: Blob Fu gathers the energy within and
converts it into a permanent stat boost.
While you start as the slowest blob, 
you will upgrade to be the fastest!

#2: When you upgrade, you shoot out a
fireball that applies a overheat. If Monk Blob
is at a high level this will also do damage!

#4: Monk Blob's boost kick will launch
his opponents into the sky!

#5: If you get KO'd, your upgrades will be
reset to the default level.

#6: There is a secret 7th upgrade level.
It is active temporarily, not permanently.
