#1: Fireball's speed boost is
multiplicative, not additive

#2: Holding down Fireball rather than tapping
it will save on energy. If you do it long enough,
you'll get a speed boost, but you'll also be
vulnerable to damage.

#3: Need more energy? Holding ''down'' 
while on the ground will cause your blob
to Focus, quintupling your energy 
production! It comes at the cost
of mobility, however

#4: Fire Blob's boost kick will apply the
Overheat effect on your enemy for 5 seconds,
doubling all cooldowns for that time!
