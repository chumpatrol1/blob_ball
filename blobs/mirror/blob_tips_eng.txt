#1: Blocking the ball as the ability is
used can completely negate it

#2: If used at the right time, Reflect
may net you a goal

#3: Mirror Blob shatters easily,
try not to encounter an offensive Blob
like Boxer Blob!

#4: Reflect's reflection power is much
stronger horizontally than it is vertically.

#5: Mirror Blob gains a reflection
status effect when using Reflect.
It reduces incoming damage slightly
and reflects that damage to the attacker!
