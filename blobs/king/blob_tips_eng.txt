#1: Tax will make your enemy much slower
and their movement much slipperier!

#2: Your kick, block and boost cooldowns
will all be reduced by a full second!

#3: You can stack the speed boost with
the stat swap from Tax!

#4: King Blob's boost kick is known as the
Royal Loan. While the opponent has Royal Loan,
their cooldowns are greatly reduced. After 8
actions are used, that enemy gets the overheat
effect while King improves his cooldowns!

#5: If an opponent has Royal Loan active,
King Blob's boost kick will increase the counter instead.
