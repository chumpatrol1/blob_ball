#1: The spike follows the ball, but beware
its travel time! The angle it hits the ball
influences the knockback direction.

#2: Hitting an opponent with the spike
deals a little damage and stun. It also applies
an effect that reduces energy build rate.

#3: Cactus Blob's boost kick steals 360
energy (about 20%) from the enemy on hit.

#4: For 200 energy, Cactus Blob's wavedash will
deal 3 damage to enemies on contact.
